      Chapter Eighteen <br>
         Stepmother turned her head and watched her walking in. She did not believe her eyes.      “What kind of poison did this doctor give me?” stepmother wondered. She turned off the TV and furiously walked in her room and grabbed her telephone. With a deep breath of anger, she called up the doctor and then shouted, “Your product is fake. It did not give any expected result”     “Madam, you have to make sure the poison got into her stomach. I am sure she did not eat the same food you gave her. Many people used my poison and in return, they always say that is very good product” the doctor convinced her from the other end of the telephone.      She cut off the line.  She said with a deep breath and anger, “I shall win this game, Sara. I am waiting for the dinner.” She walked out again. She sat furiously on the sofa.       Sarraya walked out. She noticed stepmother seemed to be furious. She thought stepmother learnt about what they, Raina and she have done.      “Please do not be angry against Raina. She has just wanted to bring me the food and mistakenly, she tripped on the doorway and made it roll down” She said with an excuse tone as she came sit on the Sofa.     When Sarraya got these words out, stepmother understood right away that she did not really eat the food she helped her.      “That is nothing my daughter” Stepmother said with smile. Sarraya smiled as she stood up and made her way in her room again.     Stepmother stood up and drove away to her shop with Raina.
                 <br>  ***-***<br>
        In the evening, Stepmother  sent  Sarraya out  with Raina. She cooked  the  dinner,  she  dropped  for Sarraya off on  the  dining  table  and  hid  the  rest  so  Sarraya could  not  see. “I am sure  you will  pass  away  this  night  as  you will  stay alone at home. You  will  end  up by you. You won’t  have  else  choice” eating that  food I helped she  said  to herself with a wicked  smile  as  she  turned  round  and  looked  at  the  food  on the  table.  She  smiled  again  and  made  her way  in her room. Sarraya and  Raina were  back,  Raina complained t o be starving.  Sarraya smiled  at  her and  said  to her,  “Go to the dining room.  Stepmother may  be  finished the  dinner.” She  nodded as  she  ran  into the  dining  room.  She  found  the food  stepmother helped  for Sarraya on  the  dining  table.  She grabbed  it and  begun to eat. She  ate  half of  the  food. As  stepmother heard Sarraya asking  to Raina,  “Did  you find  any food?”  She  came  out. “Sar a,  are  you  already  back?” she  asked  with a  hot  and successful  smile. Sarraya nodded  with smiled. “I dropped  your  meal  off  onto the  dining table.  This  is  a special  meal, Macaroni  that  you like.  Raina and  I will  pay visit  to Mrs S arre . ”  Said  stepmother.  As  Sarraya started  to walk away,  stepmother shouted  after her,  “We  shall  come back late.  Take  car e  of  yourself and  enjoy  your meal  very well”. “By  the  way,  where  is  Raina?” stepmother worried  as  she did  not  sight  her. “When we reached  here,  she  said  she  was  hungry.  I  told  her to seek food  in  the  dining room. You  can  find  her out  there.” Sarra ya  stopped  and  said  with an  innocence  smirk. Stepmother was  half dead.  She  stood  up speechless  in front  of  Sarraya for  about  one  minutes. “What  is  up stepmother?”  Sarraya worried.
